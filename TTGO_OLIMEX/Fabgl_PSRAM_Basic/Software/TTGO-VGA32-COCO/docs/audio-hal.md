# Audio HAL — TTGO VGA32

## Overview

The audio subsystem emulates the CoCo's two audio output paths and pushes the resulting sample stream to the **ESP32 internal DAC1 on GPIO25** (the TTGO VGA32 v1.4 board's 3.5 mm jack). A timer ISR running at 22 050 Hz pulls one sample per fire from a 262-sample, double-buffered scanline buffer and writes it via `dac_output_voltage()`.

A 262-sample-per-frame pitch-corrected double-buffer drives the **ESP32 internal DAC1 on GPIO25**. The output stage is a simple `dac_output_voltage()` call from the timer ISR — no PWM or LEDC involved.

**Source files:**
- `src/core/sound.cpp/h` — Sound mixing core: mux source/enable, 6-bit DAC and single-bit levels, XRoar-style gain/offset tables — board-independent
- `src/core/machine.cpp` — PIA write hooks (`sound_pia0_written` / `sound_pia1_written`) that forward PIA state to the sound core
- `src/hal/hal_audio.cpp` — DAC init, ISR, `hal_audio_set_level()` sink
- `src/hal/hal.h` — Public API declarations
- `config.h` — `PIN_DAC_OUT`, `AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE`

## TTGO VGA32 Implementation

### Hardware Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Output pin | GPIO25 | ESP32 internal DAC1 (`PIN_DAC_OUT = 25`) |
| DAC width | 8 bit | `dac_output_voltage(channel, 0..255)` |
| Sample rate | 22 050 Hz | Hardware timer ISR fires at this rate |
| Idle level | 0 | Unipolar output like the real hardware; jack is AC-coupled |
| Output route | 3.5 mm jack | On-board on the TTGO VGA32 v1.4 |

The ESP32-WROVER inside the TTGO has a real 8-bit DAC on GPIO25 — no PWM RC-filter trick needed. `dac_output_enable(DAC_CHANNEL_1)` once at boot, then `dac_output_voltage(DAC_CHANNEL_1, sample)` from the ISR. Cheap, jitter-free, no peripheral contention.

> **Driver choice:** the spec called for "I2S in built-in-DAC mode" (full DMA streaming), but the simpler legacy `dac_output_voltage()` path matches the existing scanline-buffer / commit-frame model 1:1 with minimal new surface area. Quality is fine for the CoCo's 6-bit source material. If a future DMA upgrade is wanted, FabGL's SoundGenerator or the `dac_continuous_*` driver are the candidates — both fit behind this HAL surface unchanged.

### Audio Paths

The output level is computed by the **sound mixing core** (`src/core/sound.cpp`),
modeled on XRoar's `sound.c`. The HAL is a pure sink: the core calls
`hal_audio_set_level(0-255)` whenever the mix changes.

The core tracks five pieces of state, fed from the PIA write handlers in
`machine.cpp`:

| State | Source | Setter |
|---|---|---|
| `dac_level` (0-63) | PIA1 PA bits 2-7 | `sound_set_dac_level()` |
| `sbs_enabled` | PIA1 PB1 DDR bit (pin is output?) | `sound_set_sbs()` |
| `sbs_level` | PIA1 PB1 data bit | `sound_set_sbs()` |
| `mux_enabled` (SNDEN) | PIA1 CRB bit 3 | `sound_set_mux_enabled()` |
| `mux_source` (0-3) | PIA0 CRA/CRB bit 3 (SEL1/SEL2) | `sound_set_mux_source()` |

`sound_update()` computes:

```
sindex = sbs_enabled ? (sbs_level ? 2 : 1) : 0
source = mux_enabled ? mux_source : SOURCE_SINGLE_BIT
level  = (source == DAC) ? dac_level : 0
out    = level * source_gain[source][sindex] / 63 + source_offset[source][sindex]
```

The gain/offset tables are XRoar's real-hardware voltage measurements
(full scale 4.7 V) rescaled to the 0-255 DAC domain. Consequences of this
model:

- **DAC and single-bit sound mix correctly** — the single-bit output doesn't
  replace the DAC signal; it changes the gain and DC offset of whichever
  source the mux selects (matching the real analog circuit). A PB1 beep during
  `SOUND` no longer destroys the tone.
- **PB1 as input has no effect** — three SBS states (input / output-low /
  output-high), so software leaving PB1 as an input doesn't drag the output low.
- **Pure single-bit audio works with the mux off** — square wave between
  offset 0 and 212 (0 ↔ 3.9 V), used by many games.
- **Silence is 0, not mid-scale** — output is unipolar like the real hardware;
  the jack's AC coupling removes DC.

### Pitch-Corrected Scanline Buffer

#### The Problem

The emulated 6809 executes the per-frame cycle budget (14 916 cycles) faster than real wall-clock time — currently in ~6–7 ms of the 16.67 ms NTSC frame period. If the DAC level were written directly to the output at the moment the CPU writes PIA1, every audio transition would arrive ~2.5× too early in wall time and tones would play roughly that much higher in pitch.

#### The Solution

Sample-and-replay at the correct CoCo rate:

1. **Capture**: after each emulated scanline in `machine_run_frame()`, `hal_audio_capture_scanline()` snapshots `audio_current_level` into a 262-entry buffer (one entry per scanline of the 262-scanline NTSC frame).
2. **Commit**: at frame end, `hal_audio_commit_frame()` flips the double buffer (the ISR will pick up the new buffer on its next fire).
3. **Playback**: the 22 050 Hz timer ISR walks through the buffer using a Q8 fixed-point stride calibrated so 262 samples play back over exactly one CoCo frame period (~16.67 ms).
4. **Looping**: if the ISR reaches the buffer end during the render gap between frames, it wraps to the beginning — seamless for periodic tones like SOUND.

```
machine_run_frame():
  for each scanline (0-261):
    machine_run_scanline()       → CPU executes ~57 cycles; DAC may change
    hal_audio_capture_scanline() → snapshot audio_current_level into buffer
  hal_audio_commit_frame()       → signal ISR to swap to new buffer

audio_timer_isr() [IRAM_ATTR, 22050 Hz]:
  1. If new buffer ready: swap read/write buffers, reset position
  2. Read sample from playback buffer at Q8 index
  3. Advance index by ISR_STRIDE_Q8 (wraps at 262 for looping)
  4. dac_output_voltage(DAC_CHANNEL_1, sample)
```

#### Pitch Fine-Tuning

The base stride is `262 * 256 * 60 / 22050 ≈ 183`. An `AUDIO_PITCH_TRIM` constant (currently `-6`) adjusts for residual scanline-boundary quantization error. Each trim unit changes pitch by ~0.55 %.

| Trim | Stride | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| 0  | 183 | Base rate (slightly sharp) |
| -6 | 177 | Current setting (~3.3 % lower) |

Tunable in `hal_audio.cpp`. Calibrated so `SOUND 84,20` matches `SOUND 82,20` on desktop XRoar to within ~1 %. The source of the discrepancy is per-frame CPU pace, not the output stage.

#### Bandwidth

Scanline-rate sampling gives an effective sample rate of 262 × 60 = 15 720 Hz (Nyquist ≈ 7.8 kHz). Covers the full CoCo audio range — the SOUND command's maximum frequency is well under 4 kHz.

### Timer ISR

`timerBegin(0, 80, true)` produces a 1 MHz timer base (APB / 80). `timerAlarmWrite(timer, 1000000 / 22050, true)` sets the 22 050 Hz alarm. `timerAttachInterrupt(timer, audio_timer_isr, true)` arms the ISR.

ISR cost is dominated by the `dac_output_voltage()` call — sub-microsecond on the original ESP32. With `IRAM_ATTR`, ISR placement is in IRAM and not affected by flash cache misses.

> The 2.x Arduino-ESP32 core timer API used here (`timerAlarmWrite` + `timerAlarmEnable`) is required because FabGL 1.0.9 is incompatible with core 3.x / IDF 5; the build pins to `esp32:esp32@2.0.17`. See `README.md` Build & Flash.

## Sound MUX Gating

Implemented in `src/core/sound.cpp` — board-independent. The mux state (enable
+ source select) determines which source's gain/offset row is applied.

### The Problem

Running `10 PRINT JOYSTK(0): 20 GOTO 10` would otherwise produce a continuous buzz. BASIC's `GETJOY` routine writes ~32 successive-approximation DAC values to PIA1 PA on every read. Without gating, each write would reach the speaker and produce audible clicks at the joystick polling rate.

Real CoCo `GETJOY` clears PIA1 CRB bit 3 before the ADC loop, disconnecting the DAC from the speaker via the analog MUX. After reading, it restores the bit.

### The Fix

`sound_set_dac_level()` always stores the new DAC value but only recomputes
the output when the DAC is audible (`mux_enabled && mux_source == SOURCE_DAC`)
— XRoar's conditional-update optimization, which keeps the JOYSTK ADC loop
cheap. When the mux is re-enabled or switched back to the DAC, the stored
level is applied immediately.

Mux source changes arrive via **PIA0** CRA/CRB writes (`sound_pia0_written()`
in `machine.cpp`) and take effect immediately — they no longer wait for the
next PIA1 write. When the mux is disabled, the output is the
`SOURCE_SINGLE_BIT` row: 0, unless PB1 is an enabled-high output (offset 212).

### Interaction Table

| Operation | PIA1 CRB bit 3 | MUX Source | DAC audible? | Single-bit audible? |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `SOUND 200,5` | 1 | 0 (DAC) | Yes | Independent |
| `PLAY "CDEFG"` | 1 | 0 (DAC) | Yes | Independent |
| `JOYSTK(0)` ADC loop | 0 | — | **No** | Independent |
| `PRINT CHR$(7)` beep | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| Game audio + joystick | Alternates | 0 (DAC) | During sound only | Independent |

### Shared DAC Resource

The 6-bit DAC (PIA1 PA bits 2-7) serves **dual purposes** simultaneously:
- **Audio output** — feeds the R-2R ladder for analog voltage to the speaker
- **Joystick threshold** — same value compared against the joystick potentiometer

The MUX only controls the speaker path; the joystick comparator always reads the PIA register directly. So both uses coexist without conflict in emulation.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Shared PIA resources are a CoCo design signature.** The CoCo reuses PIAs extensively for cost. Same bits that produce audio also read joysticks. Same MUX select lines that choose audio source also select joystick port/axis. Always check full hardware context before assuming a PIA bit has a single purpose.
2. **XRoar's `sound.c` is the reference** for correct MUX behavior. `src/core/sound.cpp` is an integer port of its model: full source selection with gain/offset tables matching real hardware voltage measurements. TAPE and CART source *levels* are still unemulated (treated as 0), but their DC offsets are correct.
3. **Single-bit audio (PIA1 PB1) is not gated by the MUX — but it isn't independent either.** On real hardware the PB1 pin's voltage interacts with the analog mix: it changes the gain and DC offset of whichever source the MUX selects. XRoar models this with a 3-column table index (pin-is-input / output-low / output-high), and so do we.
4. **Pitch correction requires buffered playback, not CPU throttling.** Slowing the CPU to match wall-clock rate would tank emulation FPS. Scanline-rate buffering with ISR playback at the correct CoCo rate fixes pitch without sacrificing emulation speed.
5. **The internal DAC sounds noticeably cleaner than LEDC PWM** — no carrier whistle, no RC-filter quality dependency, 8-bit linearity. The TTGO VGA32 jack is amplifier-driven and produces usable audio straight out of the board.
6. **Mixing lives in `src/core/sound.cpp`, not in the HAL.** The HAL is a sink — `hal_audio_set_level()` just stores a byte. The sound core owns all MUX/DAC/single-bit state and is shared by the CoCo 2 and CoCo 3 write paths (previously three near-identical inline copies in `machine.cpp`). This keeps the HAL board-agnostic and the mix logic single-sourced.
